# HR Predictive Analytics - Machine Learning

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in the domain of Human Resources (HR). The goal is to develop models that can forecast and understand employee attrition patterns, providing valuable insights for HR professionals.

## Aim

The primary aim of this project is to employ predictive analytics to anticipate and manage employee attrition effectively. Through the use of machine learning models, the project aims to contribute to data-driven decision-making in HR.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- HTML/CSS for Dashboard

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Random Forest Classifier:**
   - Ensemble learning method for robust predictions.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Widely-used linear model suitable for binary classification.
   - Interpretability and performance in attrition prediction.

## Procedure

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Utilized an anonymized HR dataset with diverse attributes.
   - Demographic information, job-related variables, and historical turnover data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling numerical features and treating outliers.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model optimization.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed various factors such as age, job satisfaction, and performance ratings.
   - Uncovered patterns, correlations, and potential drivers of attrition.

5. **Visualizations:**
   - Utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualizing model performance and dataset insights.

6. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Developed an interactive dashboard using HTML/CSS and Plotly for enhanced visualization.

## Output

The project outputs machine learning models with predictive capabilities, providing HR professionals with actionable insights. Visualizations and a dashboard offer a user-friendly interface for interpreting the results and understanding key factors influencing attrition.
